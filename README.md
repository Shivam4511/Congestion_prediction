# üö¶ Traffic Congestion Prediction

This project is a **machine learning-based congestion prediction system** that estimates the number of vehicles at a given traffic junction using historical traffic data.

Using a **Random Forest Regressor**, the model learns from past congestion patterns and predicts the expected traffic volume for specific junctions and time windows. It aims to assist city planners, traffic management systems, and even navigation apps in managing and optimizing traffic flow more effectively.

## üîç Key Features

- Predicts the **number of vehicles** at a user-selected traffic junction
- Utilizes **historical data** (date, time, junction ID, etc.) for training
- Helps anticipate **traffic surges** and improve **route planning**
- Trained using the **Random Forest algorithm** for better accuracy on regression tasks
